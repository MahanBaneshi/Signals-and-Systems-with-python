In the codes of this Repository, we have used the features of the Python language (numpy, matplotlib libraries) for the university course of signals and systems.
In file q1, we have defined an arbitrary discrete-time signal and then calculated its odd and even parts using mathematical formulas and numpy features and plotted them using matplotlib.
In file q2, we have calculated the real and imaginary parts of several complex functions using numpy and plotted them in matplotlib using the subplot command.
In file q3, we have performed the convolution operation for two functions using numpy features (its ready-made functions) and plotted the function.
In file q4, we have defined the convolution operation for arrays of a dimension with two loops and compared its performance with the ready-made numpy function itself.
In file q5, we first implemented and plotted the basic impulse and step functions, which have an important role in the concepts of the lesson, using the stem command. 
Then, we proved that the same convolution of a function with an impulse can be a function.
