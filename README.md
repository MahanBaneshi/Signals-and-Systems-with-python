In the codes of this Repository, we have used the features of the Python language (numpy, matplotlib libraries) for the university course of signals and systems.

- In file CA1-Q1, we have defined an arbitrary discrete language signal and then, using mathematical formulas and numpy features, we calculate the even and odd parts of that signal and plot them using matplotlib.
- In file CA1-Q2, we have calculated the real and imaginary parts of several complex signals using numpy and plotted them in matplotlib using the subplot command.
- In file CA1-Q3, we have performed the convolution operation for two functions using numpy features (its ready-made functions) and plotted the resulting function.
- In file CA1-Q4, we have defined the convolution operation for one-dimensional arrays ourselves with two for loops and compared its performance with the numpy ready-made function itself.
- In file CA1-Q5, we first implemented and plotted the impulse and step basis functions, which play an important role in the concepts of the lesson, using the stem command. Then, we proved that the result of convolution of a function with the impulse function is the same function.
